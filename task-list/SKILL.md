# Task List

Show current tasks from the Active table.

## Steps

1. Read `docs/tasks/PLANNING.md` only (not individual task files)
2. Show tasks from the Active table

## Note

The central planning file `docs/tasks/PLANNING.md` contains status of all tasks (sorted by ID) and is the single source of truth for task overview.

**Structure:**
- **Active** — Current work (in progress or not started)
- **Completed** — Successfully finished
- **Abandoned** — Discontinued (superseded, no longer relevant, incorrect approach)
